# Big-Data-course-Final-Project-hospital-similarity-search
This repository focused on implementing a similarity search system for hospital data using binary feature extraction, Minhash, and LSH.
Our team—Parisa Khanjani Malayeri, Elham Jangravi, Ahmad Bahmani, and Zavash Ghorbanpourbaboli—developed a robust system for conducting similarity searches among hospitals based on their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Leveraging PySpark, our project implements a novel approach to extract binary features from hospital datasets, generate Minhash signatures for efficient similarity detection, and utilize Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find hospital pairs with comparable COVID-19 impact profiles. The goal was to identify hospitals with similar characteristics and challenges during the pandemic, facilitating insights into hospital responses and resource utilization.

This repository contains all the necessary scripts, datasets, and documentation to understand and replicate our study. Our project demonstrates the power of big data analytics in healthcare, offering a scalable solution for analyzing hospital performance and supporting healthcare systems in crisis management
